Tasks
1.   Develop the part of the program that loads the list of ten coded words from the external file words.txt that your teacher has given you, and displays the content of this file in an appropriate way. Figure 1 shows the content of this file.
2.   Develop the part of the program that loads the three letter and symbol pairings from the external file clues.txt your teacher has given you, and displays the content of the file in an appropriate way. Figure 2 shows the content of this file.
3.   Develop the part of the program that displays the list of ten words with the substitutions made based on the letter and symbol pairings. An example is shown in Figure 3for the substitutions made for the letters A, M and N. 
4.   Develop the part of the program that allows the user to enter a letter and symbol pairing.
    a.   If the letter entered has already been matched to a symbol then they are told that the letter is already matched and they are asked to enter another letter and symbol pairing.
    b.   If the symbol entered has already been matched to a letter then they are told that the symbol is already matched and they are asked to enter another letter and symbol pairing.
5.   Develop the part of the program that allows the user to delete a letter and symbol pairing.
6.   Develop the part of the program that allows Tasks 3, 4 and 5to be repeated continuously until all symbols have been substituted by letters for each word in the list.
7.   Develop the part of the program that checks the users list of words against the external file solved.txt and displays an appropriate success or fail message.  If the puzzle has not been completed correctly, the user should be allowed to continue to try to solve the puzzle or exit the program.
8.   When trying to solve puzzles of this type, it may help the user to know the frequency with which each symbol is used in the code words.  For example, the symbol # is used eight times, * is used four times and % is used four times in the code words shown in Figure 1.
     Extend the program so that it calculates the frequency with which the symbols are used in the code words.  Display the results of this calculation in an appropriate format. 

possible ideas:
1. create a sublist in a area where we can break down cluies .txt and change them into var and eather use a llambder to replace or use a .replace() function appon lists
2. Hard wire make the problem for example make evey term in clues.txt and change this into a var eg.
        a = a
        b = *
        c = c
        d = /
        e = d
        f = &
        words = words.replace(a,b)
        words = words.replace(c,d)
        words = words.replace(e,f)
        print(words)
    apon futher thoughts this wouldasnt be a good idea as our code coudnt be changed for a ind letter and it a bit redudndent
3. write appon a  file 

assumptuions:
1. our clues.txt is always == 3 and never becomes != 3 (e.g. words.txt.appeal() > 3 or words.txt.appeal() < 3) this makes our jopob easyer
2. our user might type in a lower or upper case for this we can eather make a boolian .isupper()/.islower() or we could .upper()/.lower()

nice added bonesses:
1. make a time bar
2. add a grafical user interface(probbibly not though)
3. a menu
4. end if you enter apon ending 
4. point / score sytem
